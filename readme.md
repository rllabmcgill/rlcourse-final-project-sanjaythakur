Practical problems of reinforcement learning have continuous state and action space. This makes them unfit to be solved by tabular methods. In this project we used neural networks as function approximators to map our states to actions. We used policy gradient method REINFORCE to solve 3 locomotion tasks (Swimmer, Hopper, Ant) of MuJoCo. However, our solutions get stuck to local optima. Better exploration strategies with random restarts of the neural network will solve this problem.
